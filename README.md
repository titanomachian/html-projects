# html-projects
20250916: Created "hypertext_book_template.html". This is just a template for books I convert to HTML from PDF and EPUB files after text-recognition and some misspelling-correction. If the OCR program I use at the occasion offers conversion to HTML, I always try it out, but I keep this template around to help me remember some of the stuff I usually need.
Currently using BlueGriffon as my main HTML editor.
Still deciding on a standard way to include hyperlinks, which will function like personal increments to the books I convert.
