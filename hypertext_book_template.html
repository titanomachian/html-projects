    internal images or drawings, etc. Header tags will follow the structure of
    each book, so that will be decided case by case. Sections like "contents" or
    "index" may or may not be <ul> or <ol>. If any is preferable in order to make
    the file more accessible, I'll be sure to implement it. -->
